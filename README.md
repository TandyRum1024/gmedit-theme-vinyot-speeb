`vinyot_speeb.css`; A (relatively lame) theme for [GMEdit](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmedit)
===
This theme was built by me for personal use out of boredom back in 2019, July. Because of that the theme was/will be rarely maintained.

* On the sidemenu that appears, Click the `manage` on the `Theme` section.
* Place the theme folder `vinyot_speeb` into the folder that has just opened
* The final directory should resemble something like this :

        > config.json

        > vinyot_speeb.css
